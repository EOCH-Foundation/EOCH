EOCH - Everything on Chain for Health

http://www.eoch.top/

Improve healthcare information interoperability and experience by redistributing value of personal healthcare data accelerating the world's shift to private information decentralization.

"The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value" [1], EOCH Chain uses the advanced blockchain technologies to create a patient-oriented electronic health record (EHR) public chain and maintaining a multi- sourcing true version of healthcare data sharing platform.
In this white paper, we introduce our EOCH Chain which is a distributed and encrypted network of transaction system operating on various kinds of pharmaceutical/clinical data in the healthcare industry. EOCH chain enables users/patients to share their personal health data with other healthcare professionals such as providers, pharmacists, practitioners, caregivers, payers, etc., meanwhile records interactions with this data in an immutable, auditable, transparent and secure way. EOCH Chain is also an application development platform for other alliances or developers to build healthcare related applications that complement and engage the user experience. Users will be able to leverage their medical (both clinical and pharmacy) data to power a plethora of applications and services.

The EOCH system is a shared database storage system that will never break like some systems because we do not rely on miners who could turn their rigs to other coins, leaving the network unable to verify and therefore breaking the blockchain, rendering it useless and thus all clients losing access to their stored files. This can never happen to EOCH.
